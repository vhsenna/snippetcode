# Snippetcode [IN PROGRESS]

Snippetcode is a web application built with Golang that allows users to easily paste and share snippets of code or text.

Similar to platforms like Pastebin or GitHub's Gists, Snippetcode provides a simple and efficient way for developers and users to share code snippets, collaborate on projects, and showcase their work.
